# Evaluating the Efficiency and Safety Impact of Dispensing Robots in Pharmacy Services

## Overview

This project presents a data-driven evaluation of a dispensing robot implemented in a clinical pharmacy setting to improve operational efficiency and patient safety. Using manually collected data, the analysis examines key performance indicators (KPIs) before and after robot implementation to measure improvements in dispensing accuracy, workflow speed, and error reduction.

The goal is to provide a structured assessment of how robotic automation can enhance pharmaceutical service delivery and reduce risk in medication management.

## Objectives

- Evaluate the impact of dispensing robots on pharmacy efficiency and accuracy
- Compare pre- and post-implementation performance using manual data
- Quantify improvements in medication error rates and processing time
- Generate insights to support future adoption of automation technologies

## Data Source

The dataset was manually collected over two time periods: before and after the deployment of dispensing robots. It includes metrics related to:

- Number of prescriptions dispensed
- Dispensing errors
- Average processing time per prescription
- System downtime
- Manual interventions by pharmacy staff

## Methodology

- Descriptive statistics and trend comparisons
- Calculation of performance deltas (pre vs. post)
- Charts and visual summaries of KPIs
- Manual validation of data entries

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

| Metric                       | Description                                      |
|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Prescriptions Dispensed     | Total number of prescriptions processed          |
| Dispensing Errors           | Count of medication errors during dispensing     |
| Processing Time             | Average time taken per prescription (in minutes) |
| Robot Downtime              | Total system downtime recorded                   |
| Manual Interventions        | Instances where human override was required      |

## Key Findings

- Significant reduction in dispensing errors following robot implementation
- Noticeable improvement in processing time and operational throughput
- Fewer manual interventions, indicating improved reliability
- Overall gains in patient safety and pharmacy workflow efficiency

## Tools & Technologies

- Microsoft Excel (data entry, cleaning, and analysis)
- Python (for advanced visualization or automation)
- Performance tracking
- Charts and tables for reporting KPIs

## Skills Demonstrated

- Health technology performance evaluation  
- Manual data collection and validation  
- KPI benchmarking and reporting  
- Quality improvement in pharmacy workflows  
- Data storytelling for decision support
