# Enhancing Efficiency and Patient Safety through the Implementation of Dispensing Robots in Pharmacy Services

## Overview

This project presents a performance evaluation of dispensing robots implemented in a pharmacy service setting. Using manually collected data from two consecutive years (pre- and post-implementation), the analysis focuses on changes in key performance indicators (KPIs) to assess improvements in operational efficiency, medication safety, and patient experience.

The primary aim is to apply statistical process control (SPC) and trend analysis methods to determine whether the introduction of dispensing automation leads to measurable improvements in pharmacy operations.

## Type of Analysis

**Descriptive Analysis + Statistical Process Control (SPC)**

- **Descriptive Statistics**: Used to calculate means, percentages, and performance deltas.
- **Control Charts (SPC)**: Applied to monitor variation and detect improvement patterns across key indicators before and after intervention.
- **Improvement Charts**: Used to visualize changes over time and assess process stability.

---

## Objectives

- Evaluate the impact of dispensing robots on efficiency, safety, and service quality  
- Compare KPI trends before and after robot implementation  
- Use SPC methods to assess process stability and improvement  
- Inform technology adoption decisions through evidence-based analysis

## Data Source

Manually collected performance metrics from pharmacy operations for the years 2022 (pre-intervention) and 2023 (post-intervention). All data is de-identified.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

| KPI                                   | Measure Description                                       | Change Observed (2022 → 2023) |
|--------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| **Prescription Fill Rate**           | % prescriptions filled per month                           | ↑ 2.14%                        |
| **Dispensing Error Rate**            | Errors per 1,000 items dispensed                            | ↓ 82.74%                       |
| **Patient Wait Time**                | Average wait time per patient (minutes)                    | ↓ 27.06%                       |
| **Pharmacist Productivity**          | Prescriptions dispensed per staff hour                     | ↑ 62.40%                       |
| **Counseling Time**                  | Average patient interaction/counseling time (minutes)      | ↑ 233.33%                      |

## Methodology

- **Data Entry & Cleaning**: Microsoft Excel  
- **Statistical Analysis**: Python (`NumPy`, `Pandas`)  
- **Visualization & SPC Charts**: Python (`Matplotlib`)  

### Analysis Steps:
1. Computed annual averages and percentage changes for each KPI  
2. Constructed control charts to monitor process variability and stability  
3. Compared pre- and post-implementation mean values and control limits  
4. Interpreted trends using SPC principles

## Key Findings

- **Efficiency Gains**:  
  - Prescription fill rates improved  
  - Patient wait times decreased significantly  
  - Pharmacist productivity increased by over 60%

- **Safety Improvements**:  
  - Dispensing error rate dropped by over 80%, indicating a major safety gain

- **Patient Engagement**:  
  - Counseling time more than tripled, reflecting enhanced communication and care quality

These findings support the value of robotic automation in enhancing pharmacy service delivery and reducing variability in critical processes.
